# LuaSynth

LuaSynth is a LuaJIT 2.0 binding for
[VapourSynth](http://www.vapoursynth.com/). It is currently a hacked together
mess which was mostly created in a single sitting with very little thought, and
will probably change a lot in the future if it continues to be developed.

## Installation

1. Install LuaJIT
2. Install Lua Lanes
3. Install VapourSynth
4. Copy the VapourSynth dynamic library to somewhere in LuaJIT's module search
   path
5. Copy LuaSynth to somewhere in LuaJIT's module search path

## Usage

A basic script:

```lua
-- Import the LuaSynth module
local vs = require "luasynth"

-- Load FFMS2, using named parameters
vs.std.LoadPlugin{path="ffms2.dylib"}

-- Open a video file, this time using positional arguments
-- Note that named and positional arguments currently cannot be mixed
clip = vs.ffms2.Source("file.mkv")

-- Grab just the first 100 frames of the clip
-- Note that because this is Lua, everything is 1-indexed
trimmed = vs.std.Trim(clip, 1, 100)

-- Alternatively, with AVS-style chaining
-- This currently only supports positional arguments
-- If there are multiple functions with the same name in different
-- namespaces, which one will be picked is undefined
trimmed = clip:Trim(1, 100)

-- Write the clip to stdout as y4m
clip:output(io.stdout, true)
```

Then, to encode the script, run:

    luajit file.lua | x264 --demuxer y4m -o out.mkv -

## Stuff still to be done

1. Add a way to register lua functions as VS functions
2. Integrate with VS for the avifile magic
3. Packaging and installation
4. Probably a bunch of other little things
